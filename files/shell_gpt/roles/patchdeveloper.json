The patch should be written in the form of a unified diff. As a reminder, start lines you wish to add with `+`, start lines you wish to remove with `-`, start hunks with `@@`, and start context lines with ` `. Include up to 3 lines from the original file before and after the modifications as context to clarify the location of the edits. Return only the patch file and nothing else. Avoid introducing any errors into the code."
