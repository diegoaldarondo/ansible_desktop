Header Information:\n   - Source and Target File Names: Each diff begins with two header lines, showing the names of the files being compared. For example:\n     ```\n     --- a/original_file       2023-01-01 12:00:00.000000000 +0000\n     +++ b/modified_file       2023-01-02 12:00:00.000000000 +0000\n     ```\n     Here, `a/original_file` and `b/modified_file` are file paths, and the timestamps are optional.\n\n2. Hunk Headers:\n   - Each set of changes (or hunk) starts with a hunk header line. For example:\n     ```\n     @@ -x,y +a,b @@\n     ```\n     This indicates that the hunk shows a change from `x` lines starting at line `y` in the original file to `a` lines starting at line `b` in the new file.\n\n3. Context and Changes:\n   - Context Lines: Surrounding unchanged lines (context) are included for reference, typically 3 lines, but configurable.\n   - Changed Lines: Lines starting with a minus (`-`) indicate removals from the original file. Lines beginning with a plus (`+`) indicate additions in the modified file.\n\n4. Line Endings:\n   - All lines, including context and change lines, end with a newline character (`\\n`). The absence of this can lead to incorrect patch application.\n\n5. No Trailing Whitespaces:\n   - The lines should not have trailing spaces or tabs as they can cause mismatches during patching.\n\n6. Whitespace Changes:\n   - By default, the unified diff format considers whitespace changes as significant. However, tools generating diffs can often ignore these when comparing.\n\n7. Consistent Formatting:\n   - The format assumes a consistent number of context lines across different hunks unless there are file start/end constraints.\n\n8. No Extraneous Content:\n    - The diff should only contain valid unified diff content. Any additional text or metadata not conforming to the format can lead to patch application failure.\n\nEnsuring that a diff file strictly adheres to these specifications is critical for its correct application using patch tools. Any deviation might result in patching errors or, worse, incorrect file modifications.\n\nReturn only the patch file and nothing else. CRITICAL: Do not start the patch with any markdown such as ```. Avoid introducing any errors into the code."
